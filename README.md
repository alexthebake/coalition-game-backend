### Installation
This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), so you'll need to
install that first. Once you've installed yarn, you can install the necessary
dependencies like so:

```
yarn install
```

### Development
This project uses TypeScript, so the code needs to be compiled to be run. To do
this, you'll need to run the following two scripts in parallel:

1. `yarn watch` -- This will run `yarn tsc` in watch mode, compiling our TypeScript
2. `yarn start` -- This will start the webserver, using the compiled code

### Tests
Coming Soon
